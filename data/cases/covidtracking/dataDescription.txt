##Database Description:
The COVID Tracking Project is a volunteer organization launched from The Atlantic and dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

Every day, we collect data on COVID-19 testing and patient outcomes from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. Our dataset is currently in use by national and local news organizations across the US and by research projects and agencies worldwide. As of mid-April, our data API (which allows sites and apps to import our dataset automatically) receives about one million requests per day.

##Contents:
Contains extremely detailed *state* level data for number of positive/negatives test cases, total tests conducted, hopitalizations, number on ventilators, deaths, and more!

##Accuracy: Good.
Most of the data is scrapped from local government agencies (in the case the PA DOH). However, wherever there is gaps in the data, Covid Tracker attempts to supplement it with official reports from gov't press conferences.

Accuracy will vary with respective state's governemnt but is given a quality rating (A+ for PA DOH)

##Usefulness:
Limited. Super detailed and accurate but only contains state level data.
